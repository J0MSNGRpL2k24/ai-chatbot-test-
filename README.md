  powershell -c "irm bun.sh/install.ps1 | iex"
  ```
- **Linux or MacOS**
  ```bash

Replace `YOUR_API_KEY_HERE` with your actual GROQ API key, which you can obtain from the [GROQ Console](https://console.groq.com/keys).

4. Run the development server:

   ```bash
   bun dev
   ```

5. Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:3000` to see the chatbot in action.

## Usage

You can easily customize the template by editing the following:
